\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:Evaluation}

\NOTE{Focus on properties which can be measured, leave out others (level of abstraction, cognitive complexity).}

After having presented solutions for the Families-to\-Persons benchmark, we will now address their evaluation with respect to three measurable properties: size of the transformation definition, measured in terms of lines of code; correctness, measured in terms of passed and failed test cases; performance, measured in terms of runtime. We will leave out other properties such as level of abstraction or cognitive complexity, which are relevant, but difficult to measure. Beforehand, we will state some hypotheses concerning expected results, which will be revisited after having presented the actual evaluation results. We will conclude with some remarks on threats to validity.
