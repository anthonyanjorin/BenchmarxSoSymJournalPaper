\emph{NMF Synchronizations} \cite{SoSyM2017-Hinkel} is a bx language which has been realized as internal domain-specific language (DSL) in C\#. To specify a synchronization between a source and a target model, the transformation developer has to define a symmetric consistency relation between these models in terms of coupled consistency relations between their elements. The consistency relation is specified declaratively with the help of functions being free of side-effects. In addition, the transformation developer has to define consistency restoration with the help of procedures updating the model states in cases where there is no default restoration available. A transformation defined in NMF Synchronizations may be executed in different modes and direction. The transformation engine performs live synchronization; therefore, it requires o-deltas as input. A correspondence model is constructed at runtime, and may be accessed in the transformation definition; however, it is not stored permanently.
